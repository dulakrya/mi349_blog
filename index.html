    <h2>How It All Began</h2>

    <p>My Aunt started a tradition in my family, where every year she would take my siblings and I backpacking. Once we turned 8 we were allowed to
        join the trip, and since my two older brothers, Nick and Caleb, were four and six years older than me I had been waiting to join these summer 
        trips for as long as I could remember. I remember how on Christmas morning before I turned eight I opened a present from my aunt and found a 
        bight blue backpack, along with a sleeping bag signaling that this was the year I finally get to tag along. Then, when June finally rolled 
        around it was time for my trip.</p>
    <p>That year we traveled to Isle Royale National Park, which is a small island on Lake Superior about halfway between Michigan and Canada. After a
        9 hour trip to Copper Harbor, we stayed the night at a hotel and spent our last night doublechecking all of our equipment before taking the 
        ferry across the lake to start our 5 day trip through the woods. The next day we woke up around 5, then after a 3 hours ferry and seeing both 
        of my brothers get sea sick along the ride, we finally sailed into port. I saw port, but in reality there was a large dock, 3 small wooden buildings, and a public shower and bathroom.
        The first building was a service center, the next was a small giftshop, and the last was a restraunt that most people stopped at before setting off
        into the woods. Like the classic eight year old, I got chicken tenders as my last nice meal before heafting our packs and setting off into the woods.</p>
